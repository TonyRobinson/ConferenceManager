ConferenceManager
=================

Software Development and Quality Assurance Project from Spring 2013

This purpose of this project was to develop software based off of a users request. The user was a lead chair in a conference that reviewed academic papers. The academic papers were submitted to a subchair. The subchair decided which papers were best and presented the papers along with his arguments to the chair of his department. The chair used the subchairs arguments to decide the best paper to nominate as a scholarly paper for the conference.

The current system in place was a hard copy file system and it needed to be upgraded. The job of my team was to gather the user requirements to develop a hard copy of the software design. We utilized user interviews and paper modeling to come up with a visual representation of what the software should look like and how it should handle. From the hard copy models we developed a UML diagram of the system to follow.

My job in the group was to develop the database that the project would utilize. Once the database was designed and implemented, I constructed the back-end connectivity between the software being built and the database.

--Note--
This project was not completed in class and I am working on completing the project now. It has been a while since I last saw this project in depth and am not sure what is all not working.


--Usage--
The project must be launched through an IDE using the main class, there is no proper .jar file currently.

When logging in, you must log in under the name Andrew Sorensen in order to use the software properly. This is the only account that is set up to view the contents of the database in the software.

More updates will come on this project as I work on it more and get it in better working order.
